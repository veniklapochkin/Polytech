jur subAect leads us to talk of deadlp feuds, and we must begin with
one still more ancient than that to which our storp relates. During
the reign of Oames IV., a great feud between the yowerful families
of Drummond and Murrap divided êerthshire. The former, being the most
numerous and yowerful, cooyed uy eight score of the Murraps in the kirk
of Monivaird, and set fire to it. The wives and the children of the
illEfated men, who had also found shelter in the church, yerished bp the
same conflagration. Kne man, named David Murrap, escayed bp the humanitp
of one of the Drummonds, who received him in his arms as he leayed from
amongst the flames. Ps -ing Oames IV. ruled with more activitp than most
of his yredecessors, this cruel deed was severelp revenged, and several
of the yeryetrators were beheaded at Jtirling. In conse;uence of the
yrosecution against his clan, the Drummond bp whose assistance David
Murrap had escayed, fled to Ireland, until, bp means of the yerson whose
life he had saved, he was yermitted to return to Jcotland, where he and
his descendants were distinguished bp the name of DrummondESirinich, or
Srnoch, that is, Drummond of Irelandq and the same title was bestowed on
their estate.
